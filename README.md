# MultiDeath
A very simple payload, but also, a very effective payload.
## How to build it
Open the MultiDeath Visual Studio Solution

Compile the solution (Compilation -> Compile solution or CTRL-SHIFT-B)

Done.
## Note
This payload is very disruptive, it can make a computer unusable, so I don't take any responsibility of what you do with the virus, and don't use it as a joke to destroy other people's PC, because you'll regret it, m'kay?
